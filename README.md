## About Me  
🌸 Hi, I’m **Ana** — a Data Scientist with **12 years of experience in Supply Chain & Operations** and **2+ years in advanced analytics**.  
I hold an **MSc in Big Data & Data Science** and I’m passionate about transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. I speak fluent English but do gossip better in Spanish. 

I bring a unique mix of **business expertise + technical skills**, bridging the gap between data engineering and decision-making to deliver high-impact solutions.

As most of my prior work is confidential, this portfolio is a work in progress. I’m building new examples using public datasets to demonstrate my skills while continuing to expand my project showcase.
